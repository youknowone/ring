Factory functions
=================

In this document, you will learn:

  #. About pre-defined factories included in **Ring**.
  #. About storage backends.
  #. About Django extension.
  #. About :class:`ring.func_base.Ring` factory.


Built-in factory functions and backends
---------------------------------------

**Factory function** means the end user interface of **Ring**, which usually
looks like ``@ring.dict``, ``@ring.memcache``, ``@ring.django``, etc.

Technically the factory functions are not associated with each backend as
bijection, but the built-in functions are mostly matching to the backends.
So practically each factory function part of this document is including
backend descriptions.

**Ring** includes support for common cache storages:

.. autosummary::
    ring.dict
    ring.memcache
    ring.redis
    ring.disk
    ring.aiodict
    ring.aiomcache
    ring.aioredis


:see: :mod:`ring.func` for built-in backends.


Django extension
----------------

Creating a new factory function is also quick & easy.

Though **Django** is not a storage, it has its own low-level cache API.
**Ring** has a factory function for Django as a cache backend:

.. autosummary::
    ring.django
    ring.django_default


:see: :mod:`ring.django` for extension.


Common factory parameters
-------------------------

.. function:: <general_factory_function>(storage, [key_prefix=None,
        expire=None, coder=None, ignorable_keys=None, interface=CacheInterface,
        storage_implementation=Impl])

    :note: This is about the general factory description, not a specific
        factory called `general_factory_function`.

    :param Optional[str] key_prefix: Specify cache key prefix. Key prefix will
        be automatically created when :data:`None` is passed.
    :param Optional[float] expire: Set duration of seconds to expire the data.
        Usually the default behavior depends on the backend.
    :param Union[str,ring.coder.Coder] coder: Registered coder name or coder
        object. See :doc:`coder` for details.
    :param List[str] ignorable_keys: (unstable) Parameter names not to use to
        create cache key.
    :param Union[ring.func_sync.CacheInterface,ring.func_asyncio.ring.func_sync.CacheInterface] interface:
        Injective implementation of sub-functions.
    :param ring.func_base.StorageImplementation storage_implementation:
        Injective implementation of storage.


:see: :func:`ring.func_sync.factory` for factory definition.
:see: :func:`ring.func_asyncio.factory` for :mod:`asyncio` factory definition.
